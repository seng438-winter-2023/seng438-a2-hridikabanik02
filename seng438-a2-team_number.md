# 1 Introduction

The objective of this task is to understand  the fundamentals of automated unit testing, with a specific emphasis on testing according to the specifications for each unit. JUnit, which is a component of the XUnit framework family, is the most widely utilised unit testing framework for Java. After finishing this laboratory, we aim to possess the ability to develop automated test code utilising JUnit and other XUnit testing frameworks such as NUnit and integrate and utilise mock objects in the creation of test code.


# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

Initially we decided to go over the methods and plan out the steps we need to create the test cases in an efficient way. We started by understanding the functionality of the methods in the Range class by dividing into teams of two and discussing the possible tests. Following this, we analysed the methods in the DataUtilities calls and carried out the same steps as mentioned previously. These were very crucial steps in our plan as it gave us a deep understanding of the concepts in Unit testing.


We then discussed the possible equivalence classes for each method and designed tests to verify the expected functionality. This was done by understanding the domain of the parameters and identifying the classes with similar behaviours to avoid creating duplicate tests . We then discussed the different types of parameter types we can use and designed tests for the inputs from all the possible partitions based on the positive and negative numbers. For the Range class, we discussed all the possible range types including [positive, positive], [negative, negative], and [negative, positive] along with infinity inputs. We designed the equivalence classes for the DataUtilities using positive and negative numbers. 

Following this, we did a boundary value analysis for each of the methods and designed a test to validate the functionality of the program. These testing methods allowed us to cover the entire domain of the methods and formulate the edge cases for the methods.

Throughout this process, we developed our knowledge of Unit testing and understood the importance of black box testing. Mocking allows us to eliminate dependence on external resources or components by isolating the testing unit of code. It also provides us with better test coverage and a more reliable test suite. However, mocking makes the tests more complex, especially if you have a lot of dependencies or need to mock many different objects. Mocking also makes it difficult to catch certain types of bugs or edge cases.

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

Throughout the assignment, we ensured that all the team members understood the methods and the Unit tests. We utilised the pair-programming methodology to carry out the planning and implementation of the tests. Both the groups designed tests for the required methods and later discussed the results of the tests. This allowed us to understand our mistakes and develop the most optimal tests. We worked together and explained concepts to each other throughout the course of this assignment. This was highly beneficial to us and allowed us to complete the lab successfully. 

# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

Initially, it was hard to understand the concept of mockery and how to use it. In the initial phase, we dedicated time to grasping the concept and familiarising ourselves with the syntax. Once we had a common understanding, we moved on to testing and distinguishing between boundary value analysis and equivalence class analysis. Despite the obstacles, we were able to successfully implement all tests through pair testing in two groups. The practical experience gained from this lab emphasised the importance of being able to differentiate between various types of analysis in black box testing.


# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

The TA had a very structural way in assessing our skills in Junit. The lab documentation had very helpful references that were used to understand several concepts.
